This project is an analysis of water pressure in the Wolfcamp aquifer in northern Texas. A nuclear waste disposal site was proposed at one location overlying the aquifer, of relatively close proximity to Amarillo, Texas. To assess whether the site poses a risk, pressure measurements of the aquifer were used to fit a potentiometric surface to determine if a pressure differential exists that could bring nuclear waste towards Amarillo. It was completed to fulfill the requirements for ACMS 60855 Spatio-Temporal Statistics for Environmental Applications at the University of Notre Dame (on this note, the submission includes several manually coded algorithms and methods that are not strictly necessary to the analysis).

The project is contained in Midterm2.R, and can be run by simply executing this one file. Also included in this repository is MilikichMidterm2-final.pdf, which is a fuller report on the methodology and conclusions of this analysis.

Running this code requires that the R packages geostatsp, geoR, fields, and ggplot2 be installed.

No additional files need to be included in the directory; the data is included in the packages used in the program.

This project was run using R version 4.0.3.
